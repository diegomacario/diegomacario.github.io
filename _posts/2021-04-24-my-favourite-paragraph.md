My favourite paragraph was written by Viktor Frankl in his book [Man's Search for Meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning). For context, Viktor Frankl was an Austrian psychiatrist who spent three years imprisoned in different concentration camps during the Second World War. Here are his words:

> One day, a few days after the liberation, I walked through the country past flowering meadows, for
miles and miles, toward the market town near the camp. Larks rose to the sky and I could hear their
joyous song. There was no one to be seen for miles around; there was nothing but the wide earth
and sky and the larks' jubilation and the freedom of space. I stopped, looked around, and up to the
sky—and then I went down on my knees. At that moment there was very little I knew of myself or of
the world—I had but one sentence in mind—always the same: "I called to the Lord from my narrow
prison and He answered me in the freedom of space."

Ever since I read that paragraph a few years ago, I have thought about it often. It reminds me that even though sadness is something that arrives quickly and takes a long time to leave, one is never alone when going through that process.

It also makes me think about what a miracle "the freedom of space" is. I can't count the number of times when I have been running or climbing and Viktor's words have come to my mind: thank you Lord for the freedom of space.

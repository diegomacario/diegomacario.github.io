Hello! My name is Diego Macario. I'm a Venezuelan who now lives in Montreal, Quebec. I work as a software engineer at Shopify, where I am a member of the Spatial Commerce Team. Before joining Shopify I worked at Autodesk, where I wrote code for 3ds Max.

Over the last 5 years I have been studying computer graphics as a hobby, and I have been creating many cool applications using C++ and OpenGL. I love writing code that has visual results, which is why I have gravitated towards computer graphics. Here are some of the things that I have built:

- [Animation-Magic](https://diegomacario.github.io/Animation-Magic): A visualization of all the math that powers 3D character animations.
- [Animation-Experiments](https://diegomacario.github.io/Animation-Experiments): A 3D character animation system.
- [Dyna-Kinematics](https://github.com/diegomacario/Dyna-Kinematics): A 2D physics simulator that can record animations.
- [Super-Sunshine](https://github.com/diegomacario/Super-Sunshine): A ray-tracer with a simple scene description language.

I decided to start this blog because I have learned a lot of cool things by working on those projects, and I think that I can teach those things to other people in new and interesting ways. So if you are at all curious about how a computer can be used to draw an image, then stick around!

I also like to write about simpler things, like for example:

- Really old movies.
- Running marathons.
- Rock climbing.
- Slacklining and highlining.

If you like any of those things, then stick around too!
